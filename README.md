The projects aes_128 and sha_256 were created as parts of home-assingments for the course DD2448 Foundations of Cryptography at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm (KTH).

The last project was just me fiddeling around with very basic ciphers to get to know them a bit better, it was never finished.
